# GANs_VA

To experiment with this code you'll have to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabamarcos/GANs_VA.git
```

Then download the requirements:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

First of all I created a simple fully connected PM which gave me results like this:

After some experiments with the learning rate and updating the data normalization values, it looked like this:

As you can see they look better now but they can be improved so much.

After all I wanted to learn (this is my first implementation) so I wanted to try what it would look like if I made a CNN. (TODO)
